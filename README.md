# Computer-Vision-Project
This project was developed as part of a university assignment and focuses on using computer vision and image processing techniques to analyze the board game Mathable.  The goal was to automate the detection of new tiles placed on the board, identify the numbers on them, and calculate player scores based on game logic.
